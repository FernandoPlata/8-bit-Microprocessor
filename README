# 8-bit Microprocessor in VHDL

This project implements an **8-bit Harvard architecture microprocessor** from scratch using **Quartus**. 
It supports a custom instruction set, ALU operations, timer functionality, I/O port interfacing, and full interrupt handling logic.
The processor has been simulated and verified using waveform analysis to validate its behavior across multiple instruction sequences.

## Features

- 8-bit ALU with logic and arithmetic operations
- 16-instruction custom decoder (8x10 and 8x8 decoding schemes)
- Program Counter (PC) with reset/preset logic
- Separate instruction and data memory (Harvard architecture)
- Tri-state buses for data flow control
- Temporal control via a general control module (GCM)
- Input/Output Port with configurable direction (Read/Write)
- Timer module with programmable countdown and flag generation
- Full interrupt controller:
  - Maskable interrupts
  - Program counter save/restore
  - Accumulator handling during interrupt
- Simulation waveforms for all components (ALU, decoder, PC, etc.)
